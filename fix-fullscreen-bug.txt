As of 2022/06/19 selecting the fullscreen option on the macOS version of Veloren causes a bug, where, on next relaunch, won't let you type your password in the input box. Below is a step by step to fix the bug. (Note: I have a MacBook Air (M1, 2020))

user_name@computer_name ~ % cd Library/"Application Support"/airshipper/profiles/default/userdata/voxygen/
user_name@computer_name % ls

### This should show that "settings.ron" is in the current directory ###

user_name@computer_name % cat settings.ron

### This should show you the raw code for settings. ###

user_name@computer_name % [text_editor] settings.ron 

### Do not use the "[ ]", instead input your preferred text editor ###

### Do command+F and search for "fullscreen". This is the section of code you're looking for: ###

fullscreen: (
            enabled: true,
            mode: Exclusive,
            resolution: (1920, 1080),
            bit_depth: None,
            refresh_rate: None,
        ),

Change "enabled" to "false". Save the file and launch Veloren. You should be able to sign in.
